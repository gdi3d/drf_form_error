# Overview
It's a simple tool that allows you to show errors responses of [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) (or any other API's) on your forms when you're not working with a js framework like angular, backbone, etc.

It was designed to be used with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). But you could use it with any css framework making some minor changes.
